Indoor Car Navigation system is a finger-print based navigation system which helps the user in locating and navigating him to the desired destination (parking slot) in the indoor spaces using wireless technologies and sensors available in smart phones/handheld devices. I have implemented the project in three major stages: 1. creating the digitized version of indoor map 2. Using the Wi-Fi localization to get indoor positioning 3. Navigating the user to the desired destination. I have used the k-nearest neighbor algorithm to navigate the user to the desired destination by using the signal strengths of the Wi-Fi signals from the available Wi-Fi access points in the parking lot.
